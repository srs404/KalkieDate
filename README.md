# KalkieDate
 Was bored and wanted to try the Day.js Library. Thus, created an web app using Vanilla JavaScript that will add user given days to the current date to output the new date. Which I will use to print the expiration date for the products that I need to label in my work. Rather than using online tools with loads of ads and button click and refreshing, made my own version of it.
